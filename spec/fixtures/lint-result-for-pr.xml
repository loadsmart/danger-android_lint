This can lead to unexpected crashes.&#xA;&#xA;To solve this, you need to either find a newer version of the library which no longer has this problem, or to repackage the library (and all of its dependencies) using something like the `jarjar` tool, or finally, rewriting the code to use different APIs (for example, for http code, consider using `HttpUrlConnection` or a library like `okhttp`).">
